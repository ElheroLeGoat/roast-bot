	<p><b><span>r!clear help:</span></b><br><br><code>r!clear NUMBER</code> is simple enough to use, <i>NUMBER</i> is the amount of messages that you want to be deleted. <br><br> Example: <br><br>USER: r!clear 10 <br>Roast-Bot: Cleared 10 messages.   <br><br> <code>r!clear NUMBER</code> will still work if you add 2 or more spaces after <code>r!clear</code>. <br><br> Example: <br><br>USER: r!clear      1 <br> Roast-Bot: Cleared 1 message.   <br><br> Another incorrect way is to send just <code>r!clear</code> with no number. Roast-Bot will send a message back saying "Incorrect usage of r!clear, please provide how many messages you want to be deleted. The correct usage is r!clear NUMBER.  " <br><br> If the bot or user doesn't have the correct permissions to use <code>r!clear</code> it will return a warning message. For user not having the Manage Messages permission Roast-Bot will return "Looks like you dont have the permissions to do that :(  ". For Roast-Bot not having the correct permissions to delete messages the message "Roast-Bot needs to be given Manage Messages permissions to use this command :(  " will be sent. <br><br> Another error of <code>r!clear NUMBER</code> is trying to delete too many messages.  Discord doesn't allow 100 or more messages to be deleted in one command. You can though send multiple <code>r!clear</code> commands to delete more than 100 messages combined. If the user doesn't know about the message limit this error: The max number of messages you can delete is 100 :(   will be sent. <br><br><br> If your still having trouble with <code>r!clear NUMBER</code> please join the support server and ask in #roast-bot-help. <br><br><br><br> Server Invite Link: <br> https://discordapp.com/invite/9y8yV42</p>
